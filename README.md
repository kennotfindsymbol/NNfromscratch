# A neural network with no DL framework to recognize hand written digits

heavily inspired by [Samson Zhang](https://www.youtube.com/@SamsonZhangTheSalmon)'s [Building a neural network FROM SCRATCH (no Tensorflow/Pytorch, just numpy & math)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU)
## training files
from kaggle's [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview)

42000 images of 28*28 (flattened to (784,1) vectors)

90% training set 10% dev set


## Architecture
784(input) - 800(hidden) - 10(output)
